### Hi, I'm Ben 👨🏽‍🎓🕵🏽‍♂️

 🌱 I’m currently an aspiring web devolper, learning the basics needed to tranverse the vast universe that makes up the tech world as we all know it!
 
 Since 2020 when I noticed the quickly raising intrest in various tech skills all around the world, I have been teaching my self the basics of HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript. In 2021 I graduated with my bachelor degree in Human Resources Management and quickly began work. While I am dedicated and motivated to explore the HR world the world of tech also has a strong grasp around my mind. I am passionate about both of these very different world, but here is where I hope to post my progress for any and eeryone to see. Most of all this is my way of holding myself accontable to ensure I continue to explore this new world as far as I can!
