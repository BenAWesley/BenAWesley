# Hi, I'm Ben 👨🏽‍🎓🕵🏽‍♂️

 🌱 I’m currently an aspiring web developer, learning the basics needed to transverse the vast universe that makes up the tech world as we all know it!
 
 Since 2020 when I noticed the quickly raising interest in various tech skills all around the world, I have been teaching myself the basics of HTML, CSS, SQL, and JavaScript. In 2021 I graduated with my bachelor degree in Human Resources Management and quickly began work. While I am dedicated and motivated to explore the HR world the world of tech also has a strong grasp around my mind. I am passionate about both of these very different worlds, but here is where I hope to post my progress for any and everyone to see. Most of all this is my way of holding myself accountable to ensure I continue to explore this new world as far as I can!
